# ARGAEL: ARGument Annotation and Evaluation tooL

**ARGAEL** is an open-source Java desktop application designed to maximize the experience and efficiency of the process of annotating and evaluating arguments in large text corpora.

| C7  | Compilation requirements, operating environments and dependencies | JDK 16 |

## All Dependencies
The implemented solution depends on or make use of the following libraries:
- JDK 16
- JSON Java 20210307
- OpenCSV 4.1
- Snake YAML 1.9

## Configuration
The JSON configuration file allows configuring (in a simple and readable way) the argument model to be used during the annotation (*annotation_model* key), the quality metrics to be used during the evaluation (*evaluation_model* key), as well as some characteristics of the text documents to be used (*data* key).

The input parameters (<a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/argael/blob/main/code/Argael/Resources/config/params.json">params.json</a> file) of the tool are:
```json
{
    "annotation_model": {
        "components": ["major claim", "claim", "premise"],
        "relation_categories": ["cause: condition", "cause: reason", "clarification: conclusion", "clarification: exemplification", "clarification: restatement", "clarification: summary", "consequence: explanation", "consequence: goal", "consequence: result", "contrast: alternative", "contrast: comparison", "contrast: concession", "contrast: opposition", "elaboration: addition", "elaboration: precision", "elaboration: similarity"],
        "relation_intents": ["support", "attack"]
    },
    "evaluation_model": {
        "quality": ["incorrect", "not relevant", "relevant", "very relevant"]
    },
    "data": {
        "fileExtension": "jsonl",
        "language": "es",
        "source": "C:/Dev Projects/argael/data/proposals",
        "result": "C:/Dev Projects/argael/data/results"
    }
}
```

## System Interface

The ARGAEL interface offers two views for the annotation generation task, namely the *simple view* and the *assisted view*. Both of them allow the user to: i) identify and manually annotate ACs on a given text, ii) annotate ARs between pairs of identified ACs, and iii) interactively validate the created annotations.

### Simple Annotation View
This view, available in the *Independent Annotation* tab, allows the user to identify and annotate argumentative components and their respective relations independently, i.e., without taking into account previous annotations from other people on the same document. This view is recommended for expert or senior annotators.

### Assisted Annotation View
This view, available in the *Assisted Annotation* tab, allows the user to identify and annotate argumentative components and relations in an assisted way, i.e., it can be based on previous annotations of other users. This view is recommended for junior annotators or in cases where there is little time available for annotation.

### Annotation Evaluation View
The evaluator view, available in the *Evaluation* tab, allows --in a simple, but straightforward way-- the manual assessment of the argument units (both components and relations) annotated by other users, based on the evaluation metrics configured in the *config.JSON* file.

## Execution and use
The project has an executable package in the `\jar` folder, called `Argael.jar`. To run the tool from the Command Prompt (CMD), execute the following commands:

``` console
  cd "argael\jar\"
  java -jar Argael.jar
```
