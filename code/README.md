## All dependencies
The implemented solution depends on or make use of the following libraries:
- JDK 16
- JSON Java 20210307
- OpenCSV 4.1
- Snake YAML 1.9

## Configuration
The ARGAEL JSON configuration file allows configuring (in a simple and readable way) both the argument model to be used during the annotation and the quality metrics to be used during the evaluation.

The input parameters (<a href="https://github.com/argrecsys/argael/blob/main/code/Argael/Resources/config/params.json">params.json</a> file) of the tool are:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "fileExtension": "jsonl",
        "language": "es",
        "source": "C:/Dev Projects/argael/data/proposals",
        "result": "C:/Dev Projects/argael/data/results"
    },
    "annotation_model": {
        "components": ["major claim", "claim", "premise"],
        "relation_categories": ["cause: condition", "cause: reason", "clarification: conclusion", "clarification: exemplification", "clarification: restatement", "clarification: summary", "consequence: explanation", "consequence: goal", "consequence: result", "contrast: alternative", "contrast: comparison", "contrast: concession", "contrast: opposition", "elaboration: addition", "elaboration: precision", "elaboration: similarity"],
        "relation_intents": ["support", "attack"]
    },
    "evaluation_model": {
        "quality": ["incorrect", "not relevant", "relevant", "very relevant"]
    }
}
```

## Execution and use
The project has an executable package in the `\jar` folder, called `Argael.jar`. To run the tool from the Command Prompt (CMD), execute the following commands:

``` console
  cd "argael\jar\"
  java -jar Argael.jar
```
