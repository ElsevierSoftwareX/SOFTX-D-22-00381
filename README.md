**ARGAEL** is an open source Java desktop application designed to maximize the experience and efficiency of the process of annotating and evaluating arguments in large text corpora.

## System
ARGAEL is mainly composed of 2 views, which offer different functionalities and roles to the users.

**Annotator view**. It allows in 3 simple steps, i) the annotation of argumentative component units (ACUs), ii) the annotation of argumentative relation units (ARUs), and iii) their initial validation.

**Evaluator view**. It allows (in a simple, but straightforward way) the manual assessment of the quality of the argument units (components and relations) annotated by other users.
