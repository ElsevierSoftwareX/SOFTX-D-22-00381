**ARGAEL** is an open-source Java desktop application designed to maximize the experience and efficiency of the process of annotating and evaluating arguments in large text corpora.

ARGAEL presents a number of novelties and advantages:
- It allows using configurable, user-defined argument models.
- it supports both the generation and evaluation of annotations by multiple users.
- it provides a visual interface designed to overcome particular needs and difficulties of argumentative annotation processes, such as the exploration of the (textual) context in which an argument is given.

## System architecture

The tool is composed of several internal modules, receives a number of files as inputs, and allows the user to generate annotations and their evaluations as outputs.

## Demo video
