**ARGAEL** is an open-source Java desktop application designed to maximize the experience and efficiency of the process of annotating and evaluating arguments in large text corpora.

Some advantages of our proposed tool are:
- it is designed to support both annotation and evaluation
- it supports multiple rich argument models
- it allows users to define their own argument model (if required)
- it offers a collaborative, real-time environment with support for multiple annotators and multiple evaluators
- it allows intra- and inter-argument annotations (due to its text-driven annotation view)

## System interface
ARGAEL is mainly composed of 3 views, which offer different functionalities and roles to the users.

**(Simple) Annotator view**. It allows in 3 simple steps, i) the annotation of argumentative components (ACs), ii) the annotation of argumentative relation (ARs), and iii) their initial visual validation.

**(Assisted) Annotator view**. It allows in an assisted way (from previous annotations), i) the annotation of argumentative components (ACs), ii) the annotation of argumentative relation (ARs), and iii) their initial visual validation.

**Evaluator view**. It allows (in a simple, but straightforward way) the manual assessment of the argument units (both components and relations) annotated by other users.
